# team-member
Full-stack take-home assignment repository, using Django to implement team-member management application.
## Notes
  1. I did not use 'gitignore'. I wanted to track all files in case of reviewing the process.
  2. I used a package to store phones:
      use this command before you run the application.
      pip install "django-phonenumber-field[phonenumberslite]"
